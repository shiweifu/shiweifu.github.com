Your breath is sweet
你的呼吸是甜的

Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
你的双瞳如两颗宝石挂在空中

Your back is straight your hair is smooth
你的头发像飘柔一样自信

On the pillow where you lie
你的谎言在枕边

But I don't sense affection
但是那与我无关

No gratitude or love
没有任何感激之情或者爱意

Your loyalty is not to me
你不会忠贞于我

But to the stars above

One more cup of coffee for the road
喝完这杯咖啡就沿着这条路走吧

One more cup of coffee 'fore I go.
喝完这杯咖啡我会在前方等候着你

To the valley below.

Your daddy he's an outlaw
你爷爷不是李刚，你爸他被警察追

And a wanderer by trade
一直在跑路

He'll teach you how to pick and choose
他教你如何选择和得到

And how to throw the blade
还有如何仍飞刀

He oversees his kingdom
他自己的世界

So no stranger does intrude
没有陌生人，没有人闯入

His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food.

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go.
To the valley below.

Your sister sees the future 
你姐看到了的未来

Like your mama and yourself
像你妈和你

You've never learned to read or write
你不学无术

There's no books upon your shelf
从来不看书

And your pleasure knows no limits
但你快乐无边，享受着无知带来的快乐

Your voice is like a meadowlark
你嗓子好，老唱歌

But your heart is like an ocean
你的心像海洋一样

Mysterious and dark.
深邃的让人难以捉摸

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go.
To the valley below.
在低处45度仰望
